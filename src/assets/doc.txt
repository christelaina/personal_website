Audit Issue Management System – User Documentation
Overview

The Audit Issue Management System is a desktop application designed to help manage and track audit issues from an Excel file. It provides two main features:

A dashboard to view issues in a table and monitor their status.

An email management system to create and send reminders to responsible teams.

The program uses configuration files to store preferences, templates, and settings so it can be reused without having to change the underlying code.

Workflow

Start the application: When you open the program, it will launch a main window with two tabs – Dashboard and Email Management.

Load Excel data: You can select the Excel file that contains audit issues. Each row in this file represents a single issue, with details like Issue ID, Description, Team Name, and Resolution Date.

View Dashboard: The Dashboard tab shows a summary of all issues in a table. It displays important columns such as Issue ID, Description, Team, and Due Date. You can click on an issue to preview its reminder email.

Preview Emails: For each issue, an email preview is shown. The system automatically fills in details such as Issue ID, Description, Team, and number of days remaining before the due date.

Send or Copy Emails: You can either open the reminder in your email application (so you can send it) or copy the content to your clipboard.

Manage Templates: In the Email Management tab, you can create, edit, and save templates for reminder emails. This allows you to customize how reminders look. Templates can be linked to certain issue types if needed.

Reminders: The system can automatically check due dates and prompt for reminders based on set intervals (for example, 7 days before or 30 days before).

Key Features and Functions
Initialization and Files

When the application starts, it ensures all the necessary files exist:

config.json: Stores reminder interval settings.

email_template.html: A default HTML template for emails.

email_templates.json: Stores multiple saved templates.

dashboard_columns.json: Stores which columns should be shown on the dashboard.

If these files do not exist, the program creates them automatically.

Dashboard Functions

create_dashboard_tab: Builds the main dashboard screen. It loads the Excel file, shows the number of total issues, and creates the table of issues.

enter_audit_excel: Lets you browse and select the Excel file that holds audit issues. Once chosen, the dashboard updates automatically.

on_dashboard_select: When you click on an issue in the table, the program loads all the details for that issue and updates the email preview panel.

open_configure_columns_popup: Lets you choose which columns from the Excel file appear on the dashboard.

Email Functions

render_email_preview: Takes the selected issue and fills in the placeholders (like {{ISSUE_ID}} or {{TEAM}}) inside the email template. It then shows the complete email in a preview box.

send_dashboard_email: Opens your default email application with the previewed content so you can send it.

copy_email_preview: Copies the previewed email text to your clipboard for pasting elsewhere.

send_reminder_email / send_reminder_to_selected / send_all_overdue_reminders / send_weekly_reminders: Different options for sending reminder emails automatically depending on the due date of issues.

test_email_config: Sends a test email to make sure your email program is working with the system.

Email Template Management

create_email_tab: Builds the template management screen where you can select, edit, or create new templates.

load_email_templates: Loads all saved templates from file. Ensures at least one default template exists.

save_email_template: Saves changes you make to a template.

new_email_template: Creates a new, empty template.

delete_email_template: Deletes a template from the system.

render_live_template: Shows how the template will look when filled with example data, making it easier to design.

Automated Reminders

start_reminder_scheduler: Runs a background process that checks every hour whether issues are approaching their due dates.

check_and_send_reminders: Looks at all issues and automatically generates reminders if the due date matches a chosen interval (like 7 days before).

Typical Usage

Start the program and load your Excel file of issues.

Check the dashboard to see the total number of issues and their due dates.

Select an issue to see its reminder email.

Either copy the email to your clipboard or send it through your email program.

If needed, go to the Email Management tab to create or edit templates.

Leave the application running, and it will automatically track when reminders should be sent.

Notes for Non-Coders

You do not need to edit any code. All customization is handled through Excel, templates, or built-in settings.

Make sure your Excel file has the expected columns like “Issue ID,” “Issue Description,” “Team Name,” and “Management Resolution Date.”

If you want to change the look of the emails, use the Email Management tab instead of editing the HTML file directly.

The program relies on your default email application (like Outlook). Ensure it is set up properly on your computer.

Would you like me to also make a step-by-step quick start guide with screenshots placeholders (like "Step 1: Click Browse → Step 2: Select Excel File") so someone with zero technical background can follow along easily?

Tips & Reminders

Make sure your Excel file has the required columns (Issue ID, Issue Description, Team Name, Management Resolution Date).

Your email program (Outlook, etc.) must be set up on your computer for “Send Email” to work.

You don’t need to edit any code — everything can be managed through the interface.

If something looks wrong, check the Email Management tab to ensure the template is correct.

👉 Would you like me to also prepare a one-page “cheat sheet” version (a simplified checklist with only the key steps, no details), so that a new user can pin it next to their monitor?
